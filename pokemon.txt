1) Fetch 20 pokemons from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/


2) In the response find the pokemons sprites and information, display the front view (sprites.front_default) and the following info

 - Name

 - First ability that isn't hidden (is_hidden: false)

 - First four moves

 - All 6 stats names and their base_stat

 For example:

Name: Pikachu

Ability: lightning-rod

Move 1: Mega Punch

Move 2: Pay Day

Move 3: Thunder Punch

Move 4: Slam

Speed: 90

Special Defense: 50

Special Attack: 50

Defense: 40

Attack: 55

HP: 35

 

3) If you click on a pokemon, initiate a battle, which should display the following things:

 - The pokemon you selected, using the back view sprite (sprites.back_default), it's name and HP. The HP should be a green bar.

 - A random pokemon from the other 19 (with the front view sprite), it's name and HP bar

 

4) Once displayed, the pokemon need to battle. To do that use the following rules:

 - Pokemon attack in turns

 - The pokemon with the higher speed stat goes first

 - A pokemon deals damage equal to - (Attack / Opponent Defense) * A random number between 0 and 200

 - If a pokemon deals more than 0 damage, it should have the following animation:

     - The pokemon moves to the opponent.

     - The opponent should blink 3 times

     - The opponent HP bar should decrease

     - The pokemon that attacked, should return to its initial position

 - At the end of every turn, the damage is taken away from the opponent HP

 - If a pokemon's HP goes below 0, the battle is over


5) If you lose or win, show a text 'You Lose' or 'You Win' respectively, and a Play Again button which should repeat the steps from step 1. This button shouldn't refresh the page, but redraw the stage.
